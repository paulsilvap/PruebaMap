            Provide one or more waypoints containing a latitude/longitude pair. If you provide one
            waypoint, Xcode will simulate that specific location. If you provide multiple waypoints,
            Xcode will simulate a route visitng each waypoint.
     -->
    
    <!--
     Optionally provide a time element for each waypoint. Xcode will interpolate movement
     at a rate of speed based on the time elapsed between each waypoint. If you do not provide
     a time element, then Xcode will use a fixed rate of speed.
     
     Waypoints must be sorted by time in ascending order.
